# MODULE DESCRIPTION: You actor object
#
# $char is of the Actor::You class. This class represents the your own character.
#
# @MODULE(Actor) is the base class for this class.

##
# Skill $char->{permitSkill}
#
# When you use certain items, the server temporarily permits you to use a skill.
# For example, when you use an Yggdrasil Leaf, the server temporarily lets you
# to use Resurrection.
#
# This member specifies which skill is currently temporarily permitted. It is undef
# when there is no temporarily permitted skill.
# The temporary permission is removed once you have used the skill, or when you have
# changed map server. (TODO: are these really all the cases?)

##
# Hash<String, Hash> $char->{skills}
#
# Contains a set of skills that the character has. The keys of the hash
# are the skill handles, and the values are a hash containing the following
# items:
# `l
# - ID - The skill ID.
# - lv - The maximum level of this skill.
# - sp - The amount of SP that this skill needs, when used at the maximum level.
# - range - The range of this skill, in blocks.
# - up - Whether this skill can be leveled up further.
# - targetType - ??? Probably related to %skillsArea
# `l`

##
# Actor::Homunculus $char->{homunculus}
#
# If the character has a homunculus, and the homunculus is currently online, then this
# member points to character's homunculus object.

##
# Bytes $char->{charID}
#
# A unique character ID for this character (not the same as the account ID, or $char->{ID}).
